# Module to estimate n-gram probabilities.

# Updated by Jason Baldridge <jbaldrid@mail.utexas.edu> for use in NLP
# course at UT Austin. (9/9/2008)

# Modified by Mozhi Zhang <mzhang29@jhu.edu> to add the new log linear model
# with word embeddings.  (2/17/2016)

# Refactored by Arya McCarthy <xkcd@jhu.edu> because inheritance is cool
# and so is separating business logic from other stuff.  (9/19/2019)

# Patched by Arya McCarthy <arya@jhu.edu> to fix a counting issue that
# evidently was known pre-2016 but then stopped being handled?

# Further refactoring by Jason Eisner <jason@cs.jhu.edu> 
# and Brian Lu <zlu39@jhu.edu>.  (9/26/2021)

        #
        # To get the training examples, you can use the `read_trigrams` function
        # we provided, which will iterate over all N trigrams in the training
        # corpus.
        #

        # For each successive training example i, compute the stochastic
        # objective F_i(θ).  This is called the "forward" computation. Don't
        # forget to include the regularization term. Part of F_i(θ) will be the
        # log probability of training example i, which the helper method
        # log_prob_tensor computes.  It is important to use log_prob_tensor
        # (as opposed to log_prob which returns float) because torch.Tensor
        # is an object with additional bookkeeping that tracks e.g. the gradient
        # function for backpropagation as well as accumulated gradient values
        # from backpropagation.
        #
        # To get the gradient of this objective (∇F_i(θ)), call the `backward`
        # method on the number you computed at the previous step.  This invokes
        # back-propagation to get the gradient of this number with respect to
        # the parameters θ.  This should be easier than implementing the
        # gradient method from the handout.
        #
        # Finally, update the parameters in the direction of the gradient, as
        # shown in Algorithm 1 in the reading handout.  You can do this `+=`
        # yourself, or you can call the `step` method of the `optimizer` object
        # we created above.  See the reading handout for more details on this.
        #
        # For the EmbeddingLogLinearLanguageModel, you should run SGD
        # optimization for 10 epochs and then stop.  You might want to print
        # progress dots using the `show_progress` method defined above.  Even
        # better, you could show a graphical progress bar using the tqdm module --
        # simply iterate over
        #     tqdm.tqdm(read_trigrams(file), total=10*N)

        log.info("done optimizing.")

        # So how does the `backward` method work?
        #
        # As Python sees it, your parameters and the values that you compute
        # from them are not actually numbers.  They are `torch.Tensor` objects.
        # A Tensor may represent a numeric scalar, vector, matrix, etc.
        #
        # Every Tensor knows how it was computed.  For example, if you write `a
        # = b + exp(c)`, PyTorch not only computes `a` but also stores
        # backpointers in `a` that remember how the numeric value of `a` depends
        # on the numeric values of `b` and `c`.  In turn, `b` and `c` have their
        # own backpointers that remember what they depend on, and so on, all the
        # way back to the parameters.  This is just like the backpointers in
        # parsing!
        #
        # Every Tensor has a `backward` method that computes the gradient of its
        # numeric value with respect to the parameters, using "back-propagation"
        # through this computation graph.  In particular, once you've computed
        # the forward quantity F_i(θ) as a tensor, you can trace backwards to
        # get its gradient -- i.e., to find out how rapidly it would change if
        # each parameter were changed slightly.


class ImprovedLogLinearLanguageModel(EmbeddingLogLinearLanguageModel):
    # TODO: IMPLEMENT ME!

    # This is where you get to come up with some features of your own, as
    # described in the reading handout.  This class inherits from
    # EmbeddingLogLinearLanguageModel and you can override anything, such as
    # `log_prob`.

    # OTHER OPTIONAL IMPROVEMENTS: You could override the `train` method.
    # Instead of using 10 epochs, try "improving the SGD training loop" as
    # described in the reading handout.  Some possibilities:
    #
    # * You can use the `draw_trigrams_forever` function that we
    #   provided to shuffle the trigrams on each epoch.
    #
    # * You can choose to compute F_i using a mini-batch of trigrams
    #   instead of a single trigram, and try to vectorize the computation
    #   over the mini-batch.
    #
    # * Instead of running for exactly 10*N trigrams, you can implement
    #   early stopping by giving the `train` method access to dev data.
    #   This will run for as long as continued training is helpful,
    #   so it might run for more or fewer than 10*N trigrams.
    #
    # * You could use a different optimization algorithm instead of SGD, such
    #   as `torch.optim.Adam` (https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/optim.html).
